Facebook Api Helper

This helper module is developed for the purpose of making facebook api requests more easier and simpler to use. Personally I had to face a lot of difficulites to learn facebook api integration and loading graph api requests. The documentation that facebook provides were not so helpful to me.

This helper uses php sdk to connect and login using facebook api and curl to load graph api requests. 

Just change the desired configurations in "config.php" (appSecret, appId, permission, graphVersion) and you are all set.
